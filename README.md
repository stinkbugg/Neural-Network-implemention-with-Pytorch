# Neural-Network-implemention-with-Pytorch
Pytorch implemention of the Neural Network Class

In this assignment you will complete an implementation of a neural network class that uses `pytorch`.  You will then use it to conduct some training experiments on specified data.  The data will be partitioned into some number of non-intersecting folds.  You will train, validate and test neural networks of various sizes on all ways of picking one fold to be testing, one fold to be validation, and remaining folds to be training sets.
